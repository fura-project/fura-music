# Current Milestone

M1 — First QQ Music Vertical Slice, phase 2: authentication.

# Completed Recently

- Confirmed the upstream repository contained only the MIT license at initial commit `f439866`.
- Established the minimum product, architecture, roadmap, decision, debt, and session-memory governance documents.
- Created Flutter targets for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus a Rust workspace with domain, provider API, QQ Music client, QQ Music provider, and bridge crates.
- Proved `Flutter -> typed bridge -> Rust -> QQMusicProvider -> typed Flutter state` with a passing Linux integration test and release build.
- Added 6 Rust unit tests, a Flutter widget test, strict Clippy, and offline static-analysis coverage.

# In Progress

- Research the smallest verified QQ Music authentication behavior and define credential state without persisting secrets yet.

# Next Candidates

1. Cross-validate active QQ Music authentication implementations and record the supported protocol evidence.
2. Define credential lifecycle states and redacted diagnostic behavior with offline tests.
3. Introduce the smallest asynchronous transport contract required by one verified authentication request.
4. Expose authentication state through the provider and bridge without adding secret persistence.

# Blockers

None.

# Pending Human Decisions

None.

# Risks

- QQ Music endpoints and authentication behavior are external and unstable; protocol work needs evidence and sanitized fixtures.
- Credential handling can create account and privacy risk; temporary storage must be explicit debt and must not be mistaken for release readiness.
- A generated bridge can grow into a second business layer unless its public surface stays coarse and typed.
- Cargokit 2.13.0 assumes rustup; Linux currently uses a direct system-Cargo build tracked as TD-001, and non-Linux bridge builds remain unverified.
